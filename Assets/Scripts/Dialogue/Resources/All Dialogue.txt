OW - SHOP

G'day, Stranger!
See anything you like?
[1/E - "Can you show me your wares?"]
[2/R - "How have you been?"]

Happy to be of service!

Me? To be honest, I'm a bit...unsettled.

I have been seeing...cracks? Inconsistencies? Almost like reality itself is starting to fall apart...

Not to mention the weird monsters I've been hearing folks whisper about.

Can't help but wonder if I'm missing something, and if we're all gonna find out real soon.

But enough negativity! You're here for the goods!
[1/E - "Can you show me your wares?"]
[2/R - "How have you been?"]

I'm getting deja vu, haha! To be honest, I'm a bit..unsettled.

OW - GUARD

Greetings, Stranger. You'd best turn back. This place isn't for the feint of heart.
[1/E: "Thanks, I'll go, then."]
[2/R: "I've never fainted in my life."]

Glad you're listening to reason.

Well, this armor's too heavy for me to stop you. Just don't say I didn't give fair warning.

OW - OLD MAN

Evenin', Stranger.
[1/E: "Who are you?"]
[2/R: "Why are you wearing such a fancy necklace for farmwork?"]

The folks in town call me "Old Man Marcus"...

...but my wife Beck jus' calls me "Mark."
[1/E: "Goodbye."]
[2/R: "Why are you wearing such a fancy necklace for farmwork?"]

Ah, this? Why I just found it workin' in the fields earlier-

Wait, no, that's not right...

Maybe ol' Beck gave it to me? Ah well, my memory failin' me ain't nothing new.

For all I know, it just appeared here one day without me noticing, heh!

You have got a point, though...oughtta get rid of this 'fore it gets caught on the fence or somethin' while I'm doin' my repairs.

How 'bout you take it? You seem like an upstanding fellow who'll take good care of it. Here.

Necklace? What necklace?

Hi, Stranger! How can I help ya?
[1/E - "Can you show me your wares?"]
[2/R - "What is this place?"]

Everything's totally fine.

Fine, fine...ha...

Shall we continue business as normal?
[1/E - "Can you show me your wares?"]
[2/R - "What is this place?"]

Deja vu...but I'm not sure what you mean.

Woah, Stranger! Meshie asks Stranger to retreat! For Stranger's own safety!
[1/E: "Thanks, I'll go then."]
[2/R: "Some silly cave doesn't scare me!".]

Phew, Meshie is very glad!

This cave hold many dangers! Even the powerful Meshie is afraid! Please reconsider!!

UW - OLD WOMAN

Good evening, Stranger!
[1/E: "Who are you?"]
[2/R: "You're not from around here, are you?"]

Well, dear, the folks in town call me "Mrs. Becky"...

...but my husband Mark just calls me "Beck."
[1/E: "Goodbye."]
[2/R: "You're not from around here, are you?"]

'Not from around here?' Why, I was born and raised in this town, and I've tended this farm since I was big enough to toddle!

...well, hm, now that you mention it...

Something does seem...unfamiliar about this place. I can't put my finger on it...

Ah well, I'm sure it's just my old mind playing tricks, the practical joker.

Say, have you seen Mark, dear? He went to fix one of the fences, but that was hours ago.

If he doesn't come back soon I'll have to go looking for him.
