  - dialogue: While studying your most recent crystalline find, you began to notice
      some strange markings on its side.
  - dialogue: You began to analyze it further when the damnedest thing happened.
      The crystal began to glow a multitude of colors!
  - dialogue: The crystal then flew into separate pieces and your body began to change
      shape and feel.
  - dialogue: 'Now trapped in these different forms, you wonder how you can break
      this mysterious curse. '
  - dialogue: Perhaps the very crystals that caused this are the key? If only you
      could find all the pieces.
  - dialogue: 'Hint: After closing this dialogue, press C to see the controls!!'
